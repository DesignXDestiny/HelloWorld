        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <p>TRYING NEW THINGS
            <br>like technology.</p>
    </header>

    <div>
        <h2>Edity</h2>
        <p>This is Google's in Cloud/Drive HTML sevice.
            Not limited to, but including CSS &amp; Javascript suppourt &amp; capabilities.</p>

            <h3>Found Functions</h3>
            <ul>
                <name>Features:</name>
                <li>When typing in a tag, this program writes the closing tag: < / t a g>,
                        <br>and places the cursor inbetween so you can continue typing where you meant to.
                        This function is similar to Sublime.</li>
                <li>Variations of Dark Mode.</li>
                <li>Browser preview of page on the right side of the screen.  
                Which updates live as you work.</li>
            </ul>
            
         </section>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>I choose the "Code Playground" of SoloLearn over Google's suite of text editors. 
            It does seem like a decent back-up though as it knows several coding languages, including PHP.</p>

                Use these comparisons, research and reviews for good, not evil.
                Create "My friends are robots blog". 
                This will end up being the beginning of one of those inserts.
