# HelloWorld
Don't worry, I have since the initial /last instalment written several read me files, and made more friends.
Lets not remove it though, because in this repository I am staying true to that _explorative, __experemental__ spirit._

## This is experimental.  
New to Git Hub, not new to coding, far from professional.
I have never written a read me file before, and I have very seldom worked on projects with other developers.
It would be good for me to have habits that are conducive to group work for bigger projects in the future, or the next designer on my current work... How to be Collaborative...
__All my friends are ROBOTS or a Cat.__
