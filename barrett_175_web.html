		<h1>Internet Web</h1>
			<p>The internet is similar to a spider's web because it is connected by many links. 
				<br> That is why we can <i>surf</i> endlessly from page to page.
				<br> Like the treads of a web, these papes of information are connected. 
				<br> Fortunatly we have access to what people are thinking all over the world, 
				<br> thanks to the <em>World Wide Web</em>.</p>

				<p>Another site that I frequent for both research, pleasure, entertainment, news, and interaction is called Reddit. <br>
				  It claims to be <em>"The front page of the internet"</em>. All kinds of thing go on here, mostly people post articles,<br>
				  images and graphics to be shared with people who look up the same topic.<br>
				  There are intelectual heated debates, ignorance, and like minded folks disscusing their veiws here. <br>
				  I you would like to see what I am talking about, this link will take you to Reddit's specific page that talks about a show called <em>Rick &amp; Morty</em>.<br>
				  The television series appears on Adult Swim, Sunday nights I like to watch the new episodes with my younger brother. <br>
